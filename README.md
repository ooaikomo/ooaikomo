# 👋 Hi, I'm Oluwamuyiwa Aikomo  

> 🔐 *My mission is to make technology safer; one system, one network, one solution at a time.*  

I’m passionate about **cybersecurity**, **networking**, and **automation**.  
I enjoy exploring how systems connect, uncovering vulnerabilities, and building stronger, smarter networks.  
Every project I take on is a step toward creating safer digital environments.

### 🧰 Technical Skills  

#### 🧩 **Networking & Security**
- Access Control Lists (ACLs), Firewalls (pfSense)  
- Packet Analysis (Wireshark, tcpdump)  
- Vulnerability Scanning & Threat Detection  

#### 💾 **Systems & Platforms**
- Linux (Kali, Ubuntu), Windows Server  
- Shell Scripting & Command-line Automation  
- Virtualization (VirtualBox)  
- Network Simulation: Cisco Packet Tracer

### 💡 Projects to Explore  
- 🧱 **Network Security Setup:** Configured and tested ACLs, outbound/inbound traffic rules with pfSense  
- 🧠 **Network Analysis Lab:** Captured and analyzed live traffic with Wireshark  
- 🧰 **Automation Scripts:** Linux shell tools for process checks and log monitoring  
*(More projects coming soon…)*

### 🎯 Fun Fact  
When I’m not securing networks, I’m probably **testing open-source tools**, **tinkering with virtual labs**, or **reverse-engineering random tech to see how it works.**
