# 👋 Hi, I'm Oluwamuyiwa Aikomo  

> 🔐 *My mission is to make technology safer; one system, one network, one solution at a time.*  

I’m passionate about **cybersecurity**, **networking**, and **automation**.  
I enjoy exploring how systems connect, uncovering vulnerabilities, and building stronger, smarter networks.  
Every project I take on is a step toward creating safer digital environments.

### ⚙️ Technical Focus  
- **Network Security:** ACLs, Firewalls, Packet Filtering  
- **Systems:** Linux (Kali, Ubuntu), Windows Server, Virtualization  
- **Cyber Tools:** Wazuh, Wireshark, pfSense, Cisco Packet Tracer, draw.io  
- **Scripting:** Bash for automation and monitoring  
- **Networking:** Subnetting, Routing, Traffic Control, TCP/IP Analysis  
- **SOC & Detection:** SIEM fundamentals, alert triage, incident analysis 

---

### 💡 Projects to Explore  
- 🧱 **Network Security Setup:** Designed a multi-department network using ACLs to control traffic, restrict access, and strengthen internal security.
- 🛡️ **SOC Incident Simulation:** Investigated suspicious activity, analyzed PCAP data, and performed alert triage in a simulated SOC environment.     
*(More projects coming soon…)*

### 🎯 Fun Fact  
When I’m not securing networks, I’m probably **testing open-source tools**, **tinkering with virtual labs**, or **reverse-engineering random tech to see how it works.**

### 🧭 My Tech Philosophy  
> *“Security isn’t a one-time act; it’s a continuous mindset.”*
